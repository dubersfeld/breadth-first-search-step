# breadth-first-search-step
Java based step-by-step demonstration of Breadth First Search algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX.

I present here a Java based demonstration of the Breadth First Search Algorithm. The algorithm itself is implemented in Java on server side. Javascript is used for display and graph initialization only.

The unoriented graph edges are randomly initialized. 

The search itself is step-by-step, each Ajax request resulting in a new vertex discovery executed on server side.

When deployed on Tomcat the context root is:
